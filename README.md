# Poker Boss 

Click Here <a href="https://poker-final.herokuapp.com/">

Poker Boss is a poker management app designed to handle the smallest home games to the largest big buy-in casino tournaments. Players will sign in to create a players list and the app will then generate random player seating.  As the game play goes on, our poker timer and blinds traker will keep players infomed while alerting the manager when tables need to be condensed as players get knocked out of the tournament. We have also integrated RFID technology that can keep track of each card delt to players and the community cards.
